# MortgageCalculator

A basic mortgage monthly payment calculator.

Problems encountered:
- UI is very basic, therefore setting up the textfields and labels were straight forward.
- Setting up the calculation and the conversion of Strings to Doubles and visa versa, were the only slightly challenging components of the app.

Skills Learnt:
- Incorporating a UISlider and using it to adjust the value in a text field.
- Using the pow() function in the mortgage payment formula.
